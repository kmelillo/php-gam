This project uses Apache\PHP and Google Apps Manager to offer information 
to those users who do not have direct access to Google Apps Manager, or any Admin Roles.

index.php - this is used to load the header, main, and footer.  I decided to use main just
 in case there were other features I wanted to add other than the current use.
